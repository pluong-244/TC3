  EZ-COOK  

EZ-Cook is a private chef business where you will hire a chef to come to your home and cook for you. We
envision there will be numerous potential chefs that you can book for different meals and times during
the week. Each chef will have specialties and available hours. The Business would be targeted toward
people who have the money to hire a personal chef on occasion but don't have the time to spend cooking
or don't want to spend time cooking. 

Dependencies:

tested on Google Chrome and on Safari.
